    What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
        Remembering all the steps for cloning and setting up the repository.
    What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
        Mainly this reinforced the steps and made me more comfortable with them.
    What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
        Mostly how to do individual commands. I didn't remember how to make a branch or clone things, but we figured it out.
    What still confuses you about Git?
        I'm not sure how to get passed the typing username and password every time, but I'm about to look it up.
    How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
        It was good. I think we both did a good job communicating.
