# Reflections

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? *I was pushing a lot of stuff straight to the master by doing a merge on the command line, instead of pushing it up to GitHub and doing a PR there.*

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS? *It was helpful to have the repetition of creating pull requests, and seeing how it would look with a partner. It was nice to have the guide and my partner watching to make sure I wasn't making any mistakes. I felt more confident in my actions.*

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? *I asked a lot of clarifying questions about things that I was 99% sure on, but still wanted confirmation. It's always nice to hear that what I'm thinking is correct, just as a reassurance. I also asked about some of the commit message best practices, and got to learn a little bit about why the imperative voice is used as a best practice.*

* What still confuses you about Git? *I think I'm pretty clear on using Git now. The only thing that is really scary still is when a mistake happens. We had an incident during our GPS when I started creating changes before performing a pull from the remote, and our guide had to help us get back on track. Since it was stuff that we hadn't learned yet, I was just typing what she was telling me to, but it was all very foreign. I'm sure we will learn it at some point :-P*

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? *I really enjoyed this experience. I had a pairing session earlier today for 2.2, and we ran into a few issues that would have been helpful with the guide. I like that the guide mostly sat back and let us do our thing and figure it out, but would chime in with the occasional affirmation.*
